# ratclick
A work-in-progress compilation of menus for Adi IRC that assist in Fuel Ratting  

NOTE: So far these menu scripts are only compatible with AdiIRC. I may look into creating creating others for other IRC clients but I don't have infinite time.

Intructions:
In AdiIRC press ALT+R, then click on File - New. Copy and paste the content of the menuscripts.ini from this repository into the editor. Then click on File - Save, enter a filename such as fuelratmenus.ini and save it under %LOCALAPPDATA%\AdiIRC\Scripts (default).
