# ratclick
A work-in-progress compilation of menus for Adi IRC that assist in Fuel Ratting  

NOTE: So far these menu scripts are only compatible with AdiIRC. I may look into creating creating others for other IRC clients but I don't have infinite time.

Intructions:
In AdiIRC press ALT+R, then click on File - New. Copy and paste the content of the menuscripts.ini from this repository into the editor. Then click on File - Save, enter a filename such as fuelratmenus.ini and save it under %LOCALAPPDATA%\AdiIRC\Scripts (default).

How to use:
RIght click anywhere on the chat window on adi irc. You will see a list of all the case numbers with KGBFOAM at the bottom under the right click menu. Hover over the case number which will expand the menu. Click on the option to send it, they all do what you would expect and use the standard fuel rats lexicon.
NOTE: The !kgbfoam will send the !KGBFOAM command to whatever nick you right click on.

If you have any suggestions or want to help, please make a comment or contact me via the Fuel Rats IRC chat under the nick AlphaJarvis.
